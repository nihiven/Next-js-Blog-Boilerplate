I've been meaning to but a new router to extend the Wifi from my garage on the South side of my house to the upstairs rooms on the North side.

Introduction
 The TP-Link Archer AX11000 does a good job of looking like a fancy drone. It does not do a good job managing Quality of Service (QOS) settings.

Problems with QOS

The router uses a speed test to set QOS limits. Not sure what service it uses. Once it sets the limits, your router will manage QOS traffic distribution around those limits.

You can't explicitly turn off QOS!
